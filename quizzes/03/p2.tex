\begin{problem}
  The equation for a conic in the plane using inhomogeneous
  coordinates $(x, y)$ is
  \begin{align}
    ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + dx + ey + f = 0.~\label{eq:2.1}
  \end{align}

  \begin{enumalph}
    \item Suppose you have a given a set of inhomogeneous points
      $\bx_i = (x_i, y_i)$, $i \in \set{1, \ldots, N}$.
      Derive an expression for the least squares estimate
      of a conic $\bc = (a, b, c, d, e, f)$ passing through those points.

      \emph{
        Note: your expression may take the form of a
        null vector or eigenvector of a matrix.
        If so, you must provide expressions
        for the matrix elements.

    \item In general, what is the minimum value of $N$ that
      allows a unique solution for $\bc$?

    \item Homogenize equation ~\ref{eq:2.1} by making the
      substitutions $x \gets z_1/x_3$ and $y \gets y_1/y_3$,
      and show that in terms of homogeneous coordinates
      $(\bx = (x_1, x_2, x_3))$ the conic can be expressed in
      matrix form
      \[ \bx^T\bC\bx = 0, \]
      where $\bC$ is a symmetric matrix.

      \end{Answer}

    \item Suppose we apply a projective transformation to our
      points $\bx_i^{'} = \bH\bx_i$.
      The transformed points $x_i'$ will lie on a transformed
      conic represented by a new symmetric matrix $\bC'$.
      Write an equation that specifies the relationship between
      $\bC'$ and $\bC$ in terms of the homography $\bH$.
