\begin{problem}
  Given a set $N$ of points $\bp_i = (x_i, y_i), i \in \set{1, \ldots, N}$,
  in the image plane, we wish to find the best line passing through those points.

    \item One way to solve this problem is to find $(a, b)$ that most closely
      satisfy the equations $y_i = ax_i + b$, in a least-squares sense.
      Write these equations in the form of a \emph{heterogeneous}
      least-squares problem $A \bx = \bb$, where $\bx = (a, b)^T$,
      and give an expression for the least-squares estimate of $\bx$.
      Give a geometric interpretation of the error being minimized,
      and use a simple graph to visualize the error.
      Does this make sense when fitting a line to points in an image?

    \item Another way to solve this problem is to find
      $\ell = (a, b, c)$, defined up to scale, that
      most closely satisfies the equations $ax_i + by_i + c = 0$,
      in a least-squares sense.
      Write these equations in the form of a \emph{homogeneous}
      least-squares problem $A \ell = 0$, where $\ell = (a, b, c)^T$
      and $\ell \ne 0$.
      This problem has a trivial solution (zero vector) which is not
      of much use. Describe some ways of avoiding this trivial solution
      and corresponding algorithms for solving the resulting
      optimization problem. Is this approach more or less
      useful than the previous one? Why?
