  I discussed solution ideas with:
  \begin{enumarabic}
    \item Ivy (Aiwei) Zhang
    \item Angelic McPherson
  \end{enumarabic}
  However, all typed work is my own,
  with reference to class notes especially on homographies
  and transformations.
  I also referred to some of my earlier notes on linear algebra
  (from \textbf{MATH 22}) on the interpretations of matrices
  and their null-spaces, column-spaces, and row-spaces.
