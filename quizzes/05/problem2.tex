\begin{problem}
  Suppose two cameras fixate on a point P (see Figure \ref{fig:1}) in space such that
  their optical axes intersect at that point.
  Show that if the image coordinates are normalized so that the
  coordinate system origin $(0, 0)$ coincides with the principal point,
  the $\bF_33$ element of the fundamental matrix $\bF$ is zero.
