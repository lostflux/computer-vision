\begin{problem}
  As we discused in class, two cameras are said to form a \emph{rectified pair}
  if their camera coordinate systems differ only by a translation of their origins
  (the camera centers) along a direction that is parallel to either the $x$- or $y$-axis
  of their coordinate systems.

  \begin{enumroman}

    \item Prove that the epipolar lines of a rectified pair are parallel to
      the axis of translation.
