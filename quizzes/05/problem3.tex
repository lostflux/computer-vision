\begin{problem}
  Consider three images $I_1$, $I_2$ and $I_3$ that have been captured
  by a system of three cameras, and suppose the fundamental matrices
  $\bF_{13}$ and $\bF_{23}$ are known. (Notation: the matrix $\bF_{ij}$ satisfies the
  equation $\bx_j^T \bF_{ij} \bx_i = 0$ for any correspondence
  $\bx_i \corr \bx_j$ between images $I_i$ and $I_j$).
  In general, given a point $\bx_1$ in $I_1$ and a corresponding point $\bx_2$ in $I_2$,
  the corresponding point in $\bx_3$ in $I_3$ is uniquely determined
  by the fundamental matrices $\bF_{13}$ and $\bF_23$.

  \begin{enumroman}
    \item Write an expression for $\bx_3$ in terms of $\bx_1$, $\bx_2$, $\bF_{13}$ and $\bF_{23}$.
      \begin{answer}
        
      \end{answer}
    \item Describe a degenerate configuration of three cameras for which the point $\bx_3$ cannot be
      uniquely determined by this expression.
