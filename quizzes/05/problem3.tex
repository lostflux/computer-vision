\begin{problem}
  Consider three images $I_1$, $I_2$ and $I_3$ that have been captured
  by a system of three cameras, and suppose the fundamental matrices
  $F_13$ and $F_23$ are known. (Notation: the matrix $F_ij$ satisfies the
  equation $x_j^T \bF_ij \bx_i = 0$ for any correspondence
  $\bx_i \corr \bx_j$ between images $I_i$ and $I_j$.)
  In general, given a point x1 in I1 and a corresponding point x2 in I2, the corresponding
point in x3 in I3 is uniquely determined by the fundamental matrices F13 and F23.

1. Write an expression for x3 in terms of x1, x2, F13 and F23.
2. Describe a degenerate configuration of three cameras for which the point x3 cannot be
uniquely determined by this expression.
Hint: Consider the epipolar geometry of the situation. Draw a picture!
