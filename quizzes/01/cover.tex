\CreditStatement{
  I discussed solution ideas with:
  \begin{enumarabic}
    \item Ivy (Aiwei) Zhang
    \item Angelic McPherson
    \item Lin Shi (Q2 -- convolution vs. correlation)
  \end{enumarabic}
  However, all the typed work is my own,
  with reference to class notes especially on convolutions and correlations.
