\begin{problem}
  The continuous convolution of two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$
  is given as
  \[
    (f*g)(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(y)\ g(x-y)\ \d y.
  \]

  \begin{enumroman}
    \item Prove that the convolution of two functions is commutative,
      i.e., changing the order of operands produces the same result.
      \[ (f \ast g) = (g \ast f) \]
      \textit{Hint:} Perform integration by substitution.

      \begin{answer}
        By definition,
        \begin{align*}
          (f \ast g)(x) &= \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(y)\ g(x-y)\ \d y \\
                        &= 
        \end{align*}

      \end{answer}

    \item Prove that the convolution operand is also associative, i.e.,
      rearranging the parentheses on two or more occurrences of the convolution
      operator produces the same result:
      \[ (f \ast g) \ast h = f \ast (g \ast h) \]
      \textit{Hint:} Be careful with variables. Understand which variable should
      be integrated, and why.
