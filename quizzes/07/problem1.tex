\begin{problem}
  A small Lambertian source $\d A$ is centered at $P$
  and emits radiance $L$. The orientation of this patch is the same
  as that of a plane containing two points, $X_1$ and $X_2$.
  The point $X_1$ is the point on this plane that is closest to $P$,
  and the distance from $P$ to $X_1$ is $D$ as shown.
