\begin{problem}
  In class, we say that a camera matrix satisfies the equation
  $\bx_i = \bP \bX_i$, and that six 3D-2D matches $\bx \leftrightarrow \bX$
  are sufficient to recover $\bP$ using a linear (non-iterative) algorithm.

  \step
  Find a linear algorithm for computing the camera matrix $\bP$
  in the special case when the camera location (but not orientation)
  is known. Ignoring degenerate configurations, how many 2D-3D matches
  are required for there to be a unique solution?
  Justify your answer.
