\begin{problem}
  In class, we talked about finite-difference approximation
  to the derivative of the univariate function $f(x)$.
  Using Taylor polynomial approximations of $f(x + h)$ and $f(x - h)$,
  we can easily show that \[ f'(x) = \frac{f(x + h) - f(x - h)}{2h} + O(h2), \]
  so that the derivative can be approximated by convolving
  a discrete version of $f(x)$ --- a vector of values
  $(\ldots,\ f(x_{o} - \Delta), f(x_{o}), f(x_{o}+ \Delta), \ldots)$
  with kernel (1/2, 0, -1/2).
  This is termed a central difference because its interval is symmetric about a sample point.

  \begin{enumroman}
    \item Derive a higher order central-difference approximation
      to $f'(x)$ such that the truncation error tends to zero
      as $h^4$ instead of $h^2$.
      \emph{Hint : consider Taylor polynomial approximations of $f(x \pm 2h)$
        in addition to $f(x \pm h)$}. (7 points)
    \item What is the corresponding convolution (not correlation!) kernel? (3 points)
