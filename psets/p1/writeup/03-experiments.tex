  \item I was not sure if this is a standard change,
    but \lstinline{scipy.signal.gaussian} seems to have been
    migrated to \lstinline{scipy.signal.windows.gaussian}
    in Python 3.11 (see \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.windows.gaussian.html}{here}).
  \item I spent a few hours debugging my hough transform,
    only to realize that writing into and reading from
    an array concurrently was resulting in
    inaccuracies.
    Fixing this issue made everything work.
  \item I also had a bug in my gaussian kernel
     --- I was resizing the kernel but not normalizing it
    back to sum up to $1$, which resulted in
    a lot of spurious and inaccurate lines.
    This was a definitive fix, but debugging it took a while.

I played around with some of the parameters to see how the results
are affected.
