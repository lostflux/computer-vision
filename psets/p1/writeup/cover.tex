    This project explores image manipulation
    with convolutions and the Hough transform,
    and how we can use these techniques to detect lines in images.
    This is a computer vision project for CS 83 at Dartmouth College,
    taught by Professor Adithya Pediredla in the Winter of 2023.

      I discussed ideas with:
      \begin{enumarabic}
        \item Ivy (Aiwei) Zhang
        \item Angelic McPherson
      \end{enumarabic}
      However, the code and writeup are entirely my own,
      with reference to class notes especially on convolutions
      and hough transforms.
